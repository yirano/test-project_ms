# Test Project for MostlySerious

## About
This project is currently frontend focused using a mock API to render its data. I had a couple of options to build the backend, but I made the call to use a mock API to allowance myself the extra time to study Craft CMS. 

Everything has been set up in the root's `package.json`, so you can install and deploy from the root directory.


## Setup
1. `git clone https://github.com/yirano/test-project_ms.git`
2. Install the required packages from the root directory: `npm i`
3. Run the following script to view project from the root directory: `npm run craco`

## Built With
- React
- Craco
- Sass
- JSON Server
